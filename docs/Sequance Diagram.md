Back to the Omnibus DSL. Though bin/omnibus build demo will build the package for you, it will not do anything exciting. For that, you need to use the Omnibus DSL to define the specifics of your application.


1) Config

If present, Omnibus will use a top-level configuration file name omnibus.rb at the root of your repository. This file is loaded at runtime and includes number of configurations. For e.g.-

2) Project DSL

When you create an omnibus project, it creates a project DSL file inside config/project with the name which you used for creating project for above example it will create config/project/demo.rb. It provides means to define the dependencies of the project and metadata of the project. We will look at some contents of project DSL file

3) Software DSL
   Software DSL defines individual software components that go into making your overall package. The Software DSL provides a way to define where to retrieve the software sources, how to build them, and what dependencies they have. Now letâ€™s edit a config/software/demo.rb
